I started out by creating the html pages needed, and started to add some HTML to the homepage.
I also need to figure out if I want to use flexbox or grid. I think I might go with grid since 
it's newer than flexbox and has more oppurtunities since it's multidimentional. 
I've got some odd placed graphics in my layout (thanks former self) so I think that a 
multidimentional layout will come in handy

I've learnt from the last project that it's smart to make progress notes while I'm working, it's hard to
remember why I chose this and that, even though Im sure I'll remember it then and there when Im making the decicion. 
Therefore I make this notesheet, so I can record my thought process along the way

I have no former knowledge about CSS variables, so this will be exciting to learn more about!

--nav with flexbox, rest with grid?

changed backround color and text color variables to match the figmaprototype, 
learned that it was possible to export images from figma, 
and did that to the buttons I created special designs for in figma, 
so that I dont't have recreate them from scratch

Started making grid template ares and placing things as correctly as possible on the homepage.
Looking up how to use CSS variables and adding font CSS variable

having some trouble centering text in the menu buttons, tried justifying content with no luck
